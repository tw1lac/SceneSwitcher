# SceneSwitcher
An automated scene switcher for OBS Studio

More information can be found on https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/automatic-scene-switching.395/


## Compiling
### Prerequisites
You'll need CMake and a working development environment for OBS Studio installed
on your computer. Once you've done that, do the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/WarmUpTill/SceneSwitcher.git
cd SceneSwitcher
mkdir build && cd build
```

### Windows
In cmake-gui, you'll have to set these CMake variables :
- **LIBOBS_INCLUDE_DIR** (path) : location of the libobs subfolder in the source
code of OBS Studio, located at [source_directory]/libobs/.
- **LIBOBS_LIB** (filepath) : location of the obs.dll file (usually set to
[source_directory]/build/libobs/Debug/obs.lib)

- **LIBOBS_FRONTEND_API_LIB** (filepath) : location of the libobs-frontend-api.dll
file, usually [source_directory]/build/UI/obs-frontend-api/Debug/obs-frontend-api.lib
(usually in the same place as LIBOBS_LIB)
- **LIBOBS_FRONTEND_INCLUDE_DIR** (path) : location of the obs-frontend-api
subfolder in the source code of OBS Studio, located at [source_directory]/UI/obs-frontend-api.

Assuming that you installed Qt via the regular Qt App way:
- **Qt5Core_DIR** (path) : C:/Qt/5.13.0/msvc2017_64/lib/cmake/Qt5Core
- **Qt5Gui_DIR** (path): C:/Qt/5.13.0/msvc2017_64/lib/cmake/Qt5Gui
- **Qt5Widgets_DIR** (path) : C:/Qt/5.13.0/msvc2017_64/lib/cmake/Qt5Widgets

~~Just keep hitting configure until all the vars are filled out. Then hit generate.~~

### Linux
Most versions of Linux you can use cmake-gui or the command line.

**For the command line:**  
```
cmake -DLIBOBS_INCLUDE_DIR="<path to the libobs/ sub-folder in obs-studio's source code>"
-DLIBOBS_FRONTEND_INCLUDE_DIR="<path to the UI/obs-frontend-api/ sub-folder in obs-studio's source code>"
-DLIBOBS_FRONTEND_API_LIB="< path to the libobs-frontend-api.so file (usually in the same place as LIBOBS_LIB)>"
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
make -j4
sudo make install
```

For cmake-gui you'll have to set the following variables:
- **LIBOBS_INCLUDE_DIR** (path) : location of the libobs subfolder in the source
code of OBS Studio, located at [source_directory]/libobs/.
- **LIBOBS_LIB** (filepath) : location of the libobs.so file (usually CMake finds
this, but if not it'll usually be in /usr/lib/libobs.so)

Assuming that you installed Qt via your system package manager, it should be 
found automatically. If not, then usually you'll find it in something like:
- **Qt5Core_DIR** (path) : /usr/lib64/cmake/Qt5Core
- **Qt5Gui_DIR** (path): /usr/lib64/cmake/Qt5Gui
- **Qt5Widgets_DIR** (path) : /usr/lib64/cmake/Qt5Widgets

- **LIBOBS_FRONTEND_API_LIB** (filepath) : location of the libobs-frontend-api.so
file (usually in the same place as LIBOBS_LIB)
- **LIBOBS_FRONTEND_INCLUDE_DIR** (path) : location of the obs-frontend-api
subfolder in the source code of OBS Studio, located at
[source_directory]/UI/obs-frontend-api.

Just keep hitting configure until all the vars are filled out. Then hit generate.

Then open a terminal in the build folder and type:
```
make -j4
sudo make install
```
NOTE: The Linux version of this plugin is dependent on libXScrnSaver.

### OS X
In cmake-gui, you'll have to set these CMake variables :
- **LIBOBS_INCLUDE_DIR** (path) : location of the libobs subfolder in the source
code of OBS Studio, located at [source_directory]/libobs/.
- **LIBOBS_LIB** (filepath) : location of the libobs.0.dylib file (usually
in /Applications/OBS.app/Contents/Resources/bin/libobs.0.dylib)

Assuming that you installed Qt via the regular Qt App way:
- **Qt5Core_DIR** (path) : Usually /Applications/Qt/5.10.1/clang_64/lib/cmake/Qt5Core
- **Qt5Widgets_DIR** (path) : Usually /Applications/Qt/5.10.1/clang_64/lib/cmake/Qt5Widgets
- **Qt5MacExtras_DIR** (path) : Usually /Applications/Qt/5.10.1/clang_64/lib/cmake/Qt5MacExtras

- **LIBOBS_FRONTEND_API_LIB** (filepath) : location of the libobs-frontend-api.0.dylib
file (usually in usually in /Applications/OBS.app/Contents/Resources/bin/libobs-frontend-api.0.dylib)
- **LIBOBS_FRONTEND_INCLUDE_DIR** (path) : location of the obs-frontend-api subfolder
in the source code of OBS Studio, located at [source_directory]/UI/obs-frontend-api.

Just keep hitting configure until all the vars are filled out. Then hit generate.

Open xcode (or a terminal, depending on the build type you chose), build and copy
the advanced-scene-switcher.so file to /Applications/OBS.app/Contents/Resources/obs-plugins/
